# DS5983 Special Topics in Data Science - LLMs

## Projects

* **Project 1:** Test various n-gram models on Reuters.
* **Project 2 (ongoing):** Implement Transformer model architecture form scratch. Train the model on a machine translation task from German to English using the Multi30k dataset. Implement greedy decoding and beam search for translation.
* **Project 3:** TBD
